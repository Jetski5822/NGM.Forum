        <p>These settings control the URL length of at each level of the forum.
            
            The levels are: forums home, category, forum and thread. 
            </p>
        <br />
            An example url is:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>/ForumsHome</td>
                    <td>/Category</td>
                    <td>/Forum</td>
                    <td>/Thread</td>
                </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>/Health-Forum</td>
                    <td>/Eating-Habits</td>
                    <td>/Heart-Healthy-Foods</td>
                    <td>/Is-coffees-good-for-your-heart</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        <br />
            <p>
            Note that by default the title entered for a new level, such as a forum or thread, is used to create a corresponding url of equal length.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>*The maximum title length parameter determines the maximum number of characters that can be entered in the title at the given level.</p>
        <p>*The maximum url length is the maximum number of characters of the url.  If the title length is longer than the maximum url value, the url generated by the title will be truncated at the specified character length.
           Setting maximum url length to 0 disables truncating the title and the full title will be used to generate the url.  
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Please note that currently shorter urls are better than long urls for SEO purposes.  
            Ideally the maximum title length matches the maximum url length and is relatively short.  Keeping the two lengths the same avoids truncating a url and 
            potenially removing keywords important to SEO. 
            
            Using a shorter title length also forces the user to create more percise title but at the cost of readability and explicitness.      
             Some forums topics may not be suitable to short titles which case truncating is a reasonable option.

            *IIS has a maxUrlLength setting that limits the length of urls it will display.  The cumulative url length to a thread must be less than the maxUrlLength 
            the item will be displayable but throw an error when viewed.
